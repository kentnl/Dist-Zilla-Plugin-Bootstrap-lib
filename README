NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Bootstrap::lib - A minimal boot-strapping for
    Dist::Zilla Plug-ins.

VERSION
    version 0.04000001

SYNOPSIS
        [Bootstrap::lib]
        try_built   = 1  ; try using an existing built distribution named Dist-Name-*
        fallback    = 0  ; if try_built can't find a built distribution, or there's more than one, don't bootstrap
                         ; using lib/ instead

DESCRIPTION
    This module exists for loading either "/lib" or
    "/Dist-Name-$VERSION/lib" into your @INC early on.

    This is mostly useful for writing "Dist::Zilla" plug-ins, so that you
    may build and release a plug-in using itself.

USE CASES
  Simple single-phase self-dependency
    This module really is only useful in the case where you need to use
    something like

        dzil -Ilib

    For *every* call to "Dist::Zilla", and this is mainly a convenience.

    For that

        [Bootstrap::lib]

    on its own will do the right thing.

  Installed-Only self-dependency
    The other useful case is when you would normally do

        dzil build                 # pass 1 that generates Foo-1.234 with a pre-installed Foo-1.233
        dzil -IFoo-1.234/lib build # pass 2 that generates Foo-1.234 with Foo-1.234

    For that

        [Bootstap::lib]
        try_built   = 1
        fallback    = 0

    Will do what you want.

        dzil build   # pass1 -> creates Foo-1.234 without bootstrapping
        dzil build   # pass2 -> creates Foo-1.234 boot-strapped from the previous build

  2-step self-dependency
    There's a 3rd useful case which is a hybrid of the 2, where you /can/
    build from your own sources without needing a pre-installed version,
    just you don't want that for release code ( e.g.: $VERSION being "undef"
    in code that is run during release is "bad" )

        [Bootstrap::lib]
        try_built = 1
        fallback  = 1

    Then

        dzil build  # pass1 -> creates Foo-1.234 from bootstrapped $root/lib
        dzil build  # pass2 -> creates Foo-1.234 from bootstrapped $root/Foo-1.234

PRECAUTIONS
  DO NOT
    DO NOT use this library from inside a bundle. It will not likely work as
    expected, and you DO NOT want to bootstrap everything in all cases.

  NO VERSION
    On its own,

        [Bootstrap::lib]

    At present, using this module in conjunction with a module with no
    explicitly defined version in the source will result in the *executed*
    instance of that plug-in *also* having NO VERSION.

    If this is a problem for you, then its suggested you try either
    variation of using

        [Bootstrap::lib]
        try_built = 1
        ; no_fallback = 1   #

  SUCKS AT GUESSING
    The core mechanism behind "try_built" relies on looking in your project
    directory for a previous build directory of some kind.

    And there's no way for it to presently pick a "best" version when there
    are more than one, or magically provide a better solution if there are
    "zero" versions readily available.

    This is mostly because there is no way to determine the "current"
    version we are building for, because the point in the execution cycle is
    so early, no version plugins are likely to be even instantiated yet, and
    some version plugins are dependent on incredibly complex precursors (
    like git ), so by even trying to garner the version we're currently
    building, we could be prematurely cutting off a vast majority of modules
    from even being able to bootstrap.

    Even as it is, us using "zilla->name" means that if your dist relies on
    some process to divine its name, the module that does this must

    *   be loaded and declared prior to "Bootstrap::lib" in the "dist.ini"

    *   not itself be the module you are presently developing/bootstrapping

    The only way of working around that I can envision is adding parameters
    to "Bootstrap::lib" to specify the dist name and version name... but if
    you're going to do that, you may as well stop using external plugins to
    discover that, and hard-code those values in "dist.ini" to start with.

  STILL NOT REALLY A PLUGIN
    Starting at version 0.04000000 ( read: 0.04_0000_00 aka 0.04 + 0 x 4 + 0
    x 2 ) this module is a fully fledged class, different only from standard
    Dist::Zilla Plugins in that it doesn't partake in normal phase order,
    and only executes during a special custom "::Bootstrap" phase, which is
    more or less a different name and implementation of "BUILD", in that
    "bootstrap" is invoked after "plugin_from_config" is called ( where
    "new" is called ), which occurs somewhere in the middle of
    "register_component"

    This module also appears on the plugin stash, and responds naturally to
    "metaconfig" requests.
