Revision history for Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Bootstrap-lib

0.02000100 2013-04-06T09:53:45Z
 [Bugs]
 - 2 fallback conditions were accidentally using the same logic, so only one would ever work.
 - satisfactory build dirs accidentally lacked a 'lib' suffix, so resulted in a "fallthrough" to system.

 [!Noteworthy Changes]
 - @INC mutation now done slightly later at C<register_component>, which lets us get payload parameters out,
   while still executing the real work long before anything else. Though execution order still matters profusely.
 - 3 new parameters,
 - `try_built` tries to use a previous build instead of a "undef version" based bootstrap
 - `fallback = 1` enables `try_built` to fall back to the `bootstrap lib` form ( this is the default )
 - `no_fallback = 1` disables `fallback`
